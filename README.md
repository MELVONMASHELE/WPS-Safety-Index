# Exploring the Global Landscape of Women's Safety: A 2019-2023 WPS Index Analysis by Region

## Project Overview:
This project explores the safety of women across different countries, focusing on the most dangerous and safest places for women from 2019 to 2023. The aim is to understand the key factors contributing to women's safety globally, including societal, cultural, and legal aspects, and to provide insights into how safety can be improved in high-risk areas.

## Tools and Technologies
Global Safety and Crime Data: Sourced from the Global Gender Gap Report, UN Women, and the World Economic Forum.

National Crime and Safety Statistics: Related to violence against women and femicide from government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

Societal and Cultural Data: From international reports on women’s rights and gender equality.

Georgetown Institute for Women: Comprehensive data repository used for all data acquisition.



## Key Features
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, standardized categorical values, and addressed missing data.

Descriptive Statistics: Analyzed crime rates, femicide statistics, and gender equality indices across countries using aggregate functions.

Segmentation Analysis: Segmented the data by regions (e.g., developed vs. developing countries) to compare safety trends.

Trend Analysis: Analyzed changes in women’s safety from 2019 to 2023 using temporal queries to highlight improvements or deteriorations.

Comparative Analysis: Compared countries based on their safety indices, crime rates, and legal protections using SQL joins and calculated metrics.

## Insights
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Safety Index: A score representing the overall safety of women in a country, considering crime rates, violence, and legal protections.

Crime Rate: The number of gender-based crimes per capita.

Femicide Rate: The number of femicides (female homicides due to gender) per capita.

Gender Equality Index: A composite score based on women’s access to education, employment, healthcare, and legal rights.

Legal Protections: The strength of laws protecting women, such as those against domestic violence, harassment, and discrimination.

## How to Use
Stronger Legal Protections: Governments in unsafe countries should strengthen laws against gender-based violence and femicide and ensure enforcement of these laws.

Empowering Women: Invest in programs to empower women through education, economic independence, and leadership roles to improve safety and reduce vulnerabilities.

Regional Cooperation: Encourage cooperation between countries in the same region to share best practices and collaborate on improving women's safety standards.

Public Awareness: Promote public awareness campaigns to educate both men and women about gender equality, legal rights, and safe reporting channels for violence.

Policy Focus Areas: Countries with lower safety indices should prioritize improving legal protections, combating gender-based violence, and promoting gender equality through education and social reforms.

International Support: The analysis suggests that international organizations and governments need to focus their efforts on supporting women’s rights in countries with high crime rates and low safety indices.

Awareness Campaigns: Awareness programs on women's rights and safety could be expanded in high-risk regions to empower women and reduce the incidence of gender-based violence.

The analysis underscores the critical importance of addressing gender-based violence and promoting gender equality to ensure the safety of women globally. While some regions and countries have shown significant progress, others lag due to societal, cultural, and legislative challenges. This project highlights actionable insights and policy recommendations to foster safer environments for women, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and just world.
